positive,Ad block,2,2 positive reviews about Ad block,Bravo Jest Adblock! nie to co w Chrome czy Brave 🫵👍,"It's a very good browser with a built-in ad blocker, extension manager (even if is very limited for now) and something that surprised me is the button that allows to go to the previous site I visited. It's very practical to have this while other browsers don't have it. The only drawback I found was the lack for background media play.",
positive,Address Bar,4,4 positive reviews about Address Bar,"Mb the Best browser for Android. Hopefully they add option to move url bar to the bottom of the screen and fix the issue with cache .after sometimes of use, it eats alot of memory and need to clean cache manually every time.",Edit: Finally they added a bottum address bar. What an amazing improvement. So here are 1 more stars. But I still have trouble with casting videos (chromecast) to my TV.,"Improved quite a lot. Now just add a colorful list tab switcher (exactly like yandex browser) and a single line bottom bar with just address bar, tab switcher and more button. Also please give us the flag back to tweak webpage dark mode style to set it to selective inversion of non image elements"

Por que agora o navegador Microsoft Edeg é o melhor na minha opinião, tanto em dispositivos móveis como no PC, em todos os sentidos.

positive,Bing,9,9 positive reviews about Bing,"unlike Google, Bing ranks my company well. Funny... Duck Duck, Freespoke, Firefox, Bing, Yahoo SEARCH... Finds me in top 5. Google puts me way down the list then calls relentlessly to sell me sponsored paid placement. I refuse.",It's my default browser. I enjoy everything about it. I've even learned to enjoy the incorporation of Bing AI.,Works to make your points quota for the day. Just be careful and don't use it along with Bing as your main search engine. If your habit makes you start the day reading the latest news. If you do you risk triggering unusual activity which then not only gives you a 15 minute cooldown for months. You do it enough you can't redeem the points. So if you plan on using it to earn gift cards. I reccomend using it sparingly spreading the searches out especially when you reach level 2.

Browser is also bloated with AI, shopping, news feed and weather (can be turned off in settings). Ad blocker often leaves empty divs where ads were blocked.

It crashes every time I open an incognito tab.",badsass,"Sick of the Edge PC browser option ""Read Aloud"", always accidentally select it when I just wanted to translate a page. It always startled me when the loud voice sudden reads, and sometimes woke my grandma's good night sleep.
